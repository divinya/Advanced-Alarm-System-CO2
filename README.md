# Advanced Alarm System for CO2 Absorption and Desorption Reactors

This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection system for CO2 capture processes within digital twin environments. The system aims to detect subtle anomalies in temperature and pressure, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the capture process. It contributes to climate change mitigation by ensuring the reliability of CO2 absorption and desorption reactors.

## Project Overview

The system monitors real-time sensor data to detect anomalies in temperature and pressure. If values go beyond predefined thresholds, an alarm is triggered, and notifications are sent through Telegram. The system is designed to improve the efficiency of CO2 capture processes in industrial plants.

## Features
- **Real-time anomaly detection** for temperature and pressure in CO2 absorption and desorption reactors.
- **Threshold-based alarm system**: Alarms are triggered when sensor values exceed defined limits.
- **Telegram notifications** to alert stakeholders of any anomalies.
- **Safety checks** to ensure reactor conditions are within acceptable ranges.
- **Logging of anomalies** for further analysis and troubleshooting.
